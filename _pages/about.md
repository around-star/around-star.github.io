Hey there! I am collaborating with Dr. [Benjamin Busam](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/members/benjamin-busam/) at [TUM](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/start/). My primary research focus is on non-rigid scene reconstruction. I am also a research intern at Sony Research India where I have the fortune of being advised by Prof. [Vineeth Balasubramanian](https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/), where my focus is on various settings (open set, incremental, few-shot) concerning object detection. 

My previous research work at [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) advised by Prof. [Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/) has delved into domain adaptation and domain generalization and have published two papers in this direction. 

My current research interests lie in topics mostly surrounding **3D vision:**
* Rigid and Non-rigid Scene Reconstruction
* Novel View Synthesis
* Implicit Representation or coordinate-based networks
* Generative Modeling
