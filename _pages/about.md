Hey there! I am collaborating with <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/members/benjamin-busam/" style="text-decoration:none;">Benjamin Busam</a> at <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/start/" style="text-decoration:none;">TUM</a>. My primary research focus is on dynamic scene reconstruction. I am also a research intern at Sony Research India where I have the fortune of being advised by <a href="https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/" style="text-decoration:none;">Vineeth Balasubramanian</a>, where my focus is on various settings (open set, incremental, few-shot) concerning object detection. 

My previous research work at <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/" style="text-decoration:none;">Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore</a> advised by <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/" style="text-decoration:none;">Venkatesh Babu</a> has delved into domain adaptation and domain generalization and have published two papers in this direction. 

My current research interests lie in topics mostly surrounding **3D vision:**
* Rigid and Non-rigid Scene Reconstruction
* Novel View Synthesis
* Implicit Representation or coordinate-based networks
* Generative Modeling
