Hey there! I am currently a final year undergraduate at Netaji Subhash Engineering College graduating in June 2023. I am a researcher in the field of computer vision and have worked on a variety of projects. My previous research work at [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) advised by Prof. [Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/) has delved into domain adaptation and domain generalization and have published two papers in this direction. 

My current research interests lies in topics surrounding 3D vision:
* Rigid and Non-rigid Scene Reconstruction
* Novel View Synthesis
* Implicit Representation or coordinate-based networks
* Generative Modeling
