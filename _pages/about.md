I am a Researcher at <a href="https://www.sonyresearchindia.com/" style="text-decoration:none;">Sony Research India</a>, where I focus on multiple 2D vision tasks including open-set, incremental, few shot object detection. I am also fortunate enough to collaborate with <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/members/benjamin-busam/" style="text-decoration:none;">Benjamin Busam</a> at <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/start/" style="text-decoration:none;">TUM</a> on 4D scene reconstruction. Previously, I have collaborated with <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/" style="text-decoration:none;">Venkatesh Babu</a> at  <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/" style="text-decoration:none;">Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore</a> on the topic of domain adaptation and domain generalization.

My current research interests lie in topics mostly surrounding **3D vision:**
* Rigid & Non-rigid Scene Reconstruction and Generation
* Novel View Synthesis
* Implicit Representation or coordinate-based networks
* 2D & 3D Pose Estimation
* Generative Modeling
* Video Understanding


*I am looking for a 2025 Fall PhD position*
